# Alex's BetterNow

A Chrome extension that adds visual enhancements and quality-of-life improvements to YouNow.

## Features

### Grid View Mode
Watch multi-person broadcasts in a clean 2x2 grid layout. See all participants equally instead of one main video with a tiny guest feed. Perfect for group streams and collaborations. Screenshare broadcasts display with a picture-in-picture camera overlay.

### Auto Chest Drop
Never miss a chest drop again! Set a like threshold and your treasure chest will automatically open when reached. Features a sleek UI that matches YouNow's native design. Supports K and M suffixes (type "500K" or "1M" for quick entry).

### Individual Volume Controls
Adjust volume for each participant independently in multi-guest broadcasts.

### Sticky Header
Toggle the header bar to stay fixed at the top of the page as you scroll.
